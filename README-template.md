## My process
I opened the images on Photoshop to get the hex values of the colored used in the design. I do not have the Figma file so I had to estimate the sizes of the design elements.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned
I didn't actively developed sites for a while and it was the first time I used multiple drop shadows to get that subtle shapes behind the card itself. Thanks to W3 School for its tutorial regarding this.

### Continued development
Next up is to create my own grid using flexbox.
